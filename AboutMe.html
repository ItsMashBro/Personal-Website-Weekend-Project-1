        <h2 class="par1-header">Photography</h2>            
        <img src="chriswithfirebird.jpg" alt="firebird-pic"><p class="par1">Ever since I took photography in High School, I've been obsessed with capturing the world the way I see it with my own eyes. So that other people may experience what it's like to be me for a moment. Camera's intrigue me, the way they look and how they work is fascinating to me. In the time since those classes as a younger me, I've been practicing as a photographer for over 10 years now and I've totally surpassed what I originally wanted to accomplish. Would you like to see some of my work? Check out my portfolio on the next page to see some of my gallery.</p>    
        <h2 class="par2-header">Video Production and Editing</h2>
        <img src="studio.jpg" alt="studio-pic"><p class="par2">In my free time I really enjoy playing video games and as I've gotten older and gained a love for content creation, I decided I wanted to share that with other people. Everything I know about recording and editing, I've taught myself. I've spent thousands of hours learning how to do this stuff just so I can make videos that I'm pleased with.</p>    
        <h2 class="par3-header">Streaming</h2>
        <img src="studio.jpg" alt="studio-pic2"><p class="par3">I stream on Twitch almost every day, or whenever I have free time. Right now I'm in school, so I'm taking a break from streaming for now. But after the holidays I will be back! I play lots of survival games, strategy games, and the occasional FPS. So if you enjoy that sort of thing come check out my Twitch channel.</p>
